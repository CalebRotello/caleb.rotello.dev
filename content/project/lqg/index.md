title: Loop Quantum Gravity on a Quantum Computer
summary: Reproducing algorithms to calculate spinfoam amplitudes of quantum tetrahedra in the loop quantum gravity theory, on Google's Sycamore Processor. Not quite enough work to make a publication, but enough to make a project page, which I will create soon.
