I am a researcher at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/index.html), in the [Complex Systems Simulation and Optimization](https://www.nrel.gov/computational-science/) group.

I received my master's degree in Quantum Engineering from the [Colorado School of Mines](https://quantum.mines.edu), under the advisement of [Dr. Eliot Kapit](https://physics.mines.edu/project/kapit-group/). I did my undergraduate in Computer Science at Mines as well.

# A website, because all my friends are doing it
It seems like everyone successfully navigating the modern research landscape has one of these. This is my attempt to avoid long-term local minima in this area.

## about me
My name is Caleb Rotello; I am currently a Quantum Information Scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. I research quantum technologies, specifically quantum computer algorithms, and how they interface with renewable energy. I am currently looking for Ph.D. student positions (applying to go back to school) in quantum information science, statistics, game theory, or computational neuroscience across the U.S. 

I am a Colorado native who grew up in (what used to be) North Denver farming community. I enjoy hiking, skiing, bouldering, rock climbing, mountain biking, caving, and golf. I also enjoy poetry (writing and reading it), psychology, composing music, classic literature, and learning languages (although I am barely lingual).
