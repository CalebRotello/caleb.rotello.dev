# ME
This is the code for my personal website, built with the [academic template](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic) from [wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) by following [this](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/get-started/) tutorial.

The website is build with the Github Actions, and published to a branch called `gh-pages` in the folder `public`, which Git Pages is configured to look for.
