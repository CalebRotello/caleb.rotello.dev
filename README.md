# A website, because I have to
It seems like everyone successfully navigating the modern research landscape has one of these. This is my attempt to make a professional looking website.

## About Me
My name is Caleb Rotello; I am currently a Quantum Information Scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. I research quantum technologies, specifically quantum computer algorithms, and how they interface with renewable energy. I am currently looking for Ph.D. student positions (as in applying to go back to school) across the U.S. 

I am a Colorado native who grew up in (what used to be) North Denver farming community. I enjoy hiking, skiing, bouldering, rock climbing, mountain biking, caving, and golf. I also have enjoy poetry (writing and reading), psychology, composing music, and learning languages (if you speak to me, I am barely lingual).
