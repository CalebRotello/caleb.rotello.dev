I am a researcher at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/index.html), in the [Complex Systems Simulation and Optimization](https://www.nrel.gov/computational-science/) group.

I received my master's degree in Quantum Engineering from the [Colorado School of Mines](https://quantum.mines.edu), under the advisement of [Dr. Eliot Kapit](https://physics.mines.edu/project/kapit-group/). I did my undergraduate in Computer Science at Mines as well.

### recent
+ Dec 23 2024 - I was awarded a 2024 Key Contributor Award by NREL!
+ Nov 30 2024 - I write my first single-authored paper, ``Quantum algorithm for approximating the expected value of a random-exist quantified oracle'' [arXiv:2412:00567](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00567)


# A website, because I have to
It seems like everyone successfully navigating the modern research landscape has one of these. This is my attempt to make a professional looking website.

## about me
My name is Caleb Rotello; I am currently a Quantum Information Scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. I research quantum technologies, specifically quantum computer algorithms, and how they interface with renewable energy. I am currently looking for Ph.D. student positions (as in applying to go back to school) across the U.S. 

I am a Colorado native who grew up in (what used to be) North Denver farming community. I enjoy hiking, skiing, bouldering, rock climbing, mountain biking, caving, and golf. I also enjoy poetry (writing and reading it), psychology, composing music, classic literature, and learning languages (although I am barely lingual).
